    In his grandfather's notebook Nicola found a description of the old game <strong>"Bulls and Cows"</strong>, popular amongst humans.
    He wants to try and play it with Stephan, but Nicola does not like to lose.
    That's where we come in! Write a program for this game (for guessing).
</p>

<p>
    The host thinks up a 4-digits sequence. The digits must all be different.
    Then, in turn, you try to guess the sequence.
    If the matching digits are on their right positions, they are called "bulls", when they are on different positions, they are "cows".
    The host tells you how many "bulls" and "cows" you've guessed.
    You should solve the code in up to <strong>eight turns</strong> (but it's possible with seven turns).
</p>

<p>
    On each step, your function receives a list with information from the last steps.
    Each element of the list contains your guess and its result in the following format
    <strong>"XXXX YBZC"</strong>, where:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>XXXX is a guess</li>
    <li>Y is a quantity of "bulls"</li>
    <li>Z is a quantity of "cows"</li>
</ul>

<p>
    For each step your function returns your new guess as a string with four digits.
</p>

<p>Let's consider an example. The hidden code is "5612". At the start your function receives an empty list.
    Your guess is "1234" -- two digits are on different positions but appear in the code.
    So the next call will be ["1234 0B2C"]. Your next guess is "6512" -- two "bulls", two "cows".
    The next input is ["1234 0B2C", "6512 2B2C"]. And the last guess is "5612". Aaand you win!</p>
<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Information from your last steps as a list of strings.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The guess as a string.

        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: python">
checkio([])  # "1234"
checkio(["1234 0B2C"])  # "6512"
checkio(["1234 0B2C", "6512 2B2C"])  # "5612" and you win.
    </pre>
</div>

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    This is a simple game that might even amuse you without doing much coding.
    But when you do code, your algorithm is an example of what prediction software looks like.
</p>


<p>
    <strong>Precondition:</strong>Step information satisfies regexp "[0-9]{4} [0-4]B[0-4]C"<br>
