    In the grandpa's notebook Nicola found the description of the old human game <strong>"Bulls and Cows"</strong>.
    He wants to play with Stephan, but Nicola does not like to lose.
    And so we should help and write the program for this game (for guessing).
</p>

<p>
    The host thinks 4-digits sequence. The digits must be all different.
    Then, in turn, you try to guess the sequence.
    If the matching digits are on their right positions, they are "bulls", if on different positions, they are "cows".
    The host says you how many "bulls" and "cows" in your guess.
    You should solve the code up to <strong>seven turns</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    On each step your function receives a list with information from last steps.
    Each element of the list contains your guess and the result for it in the follow format
    <strong>"XXXX YBZC"</strong>, where:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>XXXX is a guess</li>
    <li>Y is a quantity of "bulls"</li>
    <li>XXXX is a quantity of "cows"</li>
</ul>

<p>
    For each step your function returns your new guess as a string with four digits.
</p>

<p>Let's consider an example. The hidden code is "5612". At the start your function receives the empty list.
    Your guess is "1234" -- two digits on the different positions but for the code.
    So the next call will be ["1234 0B2C"]. The next guess is "6512" -- two "bulls", two "cows".
    The next input is ["1234 0B2C", "6512 2B2C"]. And the last guess is "5612" and you win.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> A list with information from last steps.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The guess as a string.

        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: python">
checkio([])  # "1234"
checkio(["1234 0B2C"])  # "6512"
checkio(["1234 0B2C", "6512 2B2C"])  # "5612" and you win.
    </pre>
</div>

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    This is a simple game that can amuse you (especially if play only with mind).
    But also your algorithm is an example of the prediction software.
